Major features include:

* Option to grab a random set of posts based on the other criteria you set previously. (i.e. If you want five post from a specific category, selecting "Random" would grab five random posts from the selected category.)
* Choose to <em>not</em> remove HTML from titles. This allows authors to use HTML in their titles. (Could be a security risk if your authors are not trustworthy!)
* Sort excerpts by hottest topic. (Posts with the most comments.)
