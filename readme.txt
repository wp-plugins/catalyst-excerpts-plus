Catalyst Excerpts (Plus) builds on the Catalyst Excerpts widget for users of the Catalyst framework.

== Description ==

Catalyst Excerpts Plus builds on the Catalyst Excerpts widget with additional features. This is based on the Catalyst Excerpts Widget created by Eric Hamm that comes with the Catalyst Framework. This plugin <strong><em>requires the Catalyst framework</em></strong> in order to work properly. <a href="http://imnotmarvin.com/wordpress-accelerated-catalyst-theme/" target="_blank">Learn more about Catalyst...</a>

Major features include:

* Option to grab a random set of posts based on the other criteria you set previously. (i.e. If you want five post from a specific category, selecting "Random" would grab five random posts from the selected category.)
* Choose to <em>not</em> remove HTML from titles. This allows authors to use HTML in their titles. (Could be a security risk if your authors are not trustworthy!)
* Sort excerpts by hottest or coldest topic. (Posts with most/least comments.)
* Additional thumbnail position control to place thumbnail below excerpt content if desired.
* Display latest tweets (Ignores tweets starting with @)
